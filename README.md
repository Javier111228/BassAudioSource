--->﻿# Bass Audio Source

Bass Audio Source is a free and open-source DirectShow filter. The filter allows you to play audio files supported by the BASS library in media players with DirectShow support.


## Installation

1. Download ZIP file: BassAudioSource.zip or BassAudioSource64.zip.

2. Unpack the ZIP file into a separate folder.

3. Run Install_BassAudioSource_32.cmd or Install_BassAudioSource_64.cmd as administrator.

4. If you want to use a filter for all supported files and streams, then add BassAudioSource.ax or BassAudioSource64.ax to the list of external filters of MPC-BE, MPC-HC or other DirectShow player and set "prefer".

5. Open the audio file in the DirectShow player.


## MIDI support

To play MIDI files, you need to copy the SoundFont file (.sf2, .sfz) to the folder with the installed BassAudioSource and select it in the settings.

PS: Links to a couple of SF2 files are available in the [BASSMIDI plugin description](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html#addons).
